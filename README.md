# COMP3328-EmbeddedSytems
Embedded Systems lab and class studies

## Decrypt the message:
In this task we are decyripting a message using h(g(f(x))) which:
- f(x)=2x+4EH
- g(x)=x/2+47H
- h(x)=x mod 7BH
  
  We had to use at least 3 string instructions, less than 3 string instruction will result in less points for labwork
